# The Carpentries Lab Editor/Reviewer Conflict of Interest Policy

_Note: much of this text is copied from the policy used by RopenSci for their open software review process._

Following criteria are meant to be a guide for what constitutes a conflict of interest for an editor or reviewer. The potential editor or reviewer has a conflict of interest if:

- The authors with a major role are from the potential reviewer/editorâ€™s institution or institutional component (e.g., department)
- Within in the past three years, the potential reviewer/editor has been a collaborator or has had any other professional relationship with any person on the lesson who has a major role
- The potential reviewer/editor serves as a member of the advisory board for the project under review
- The potential reviewer/editor would receive a direct or indirect financial benefit if the lesson is accepted
- The potential reviewer/editor has significantly contributed to a competitor project
- There is also a lifetime COI for the family members, business partners, and thesis student/advisor or mentor

In the case where none of the associate editors can serve as editor, an external guest editor will be recruited.

## Carpentries Community Collaborations

Members of The Carpentries community may find themselves in varying levels of collaboration with other community members, constituting varying degrees of conflict of interest. In the interest of keeping larger pools of potential reviewers and not discouraging participation in multiple aspects of the community, we have outlined a non-exhaustive list of some disqualifying and non-disqualifying conflicts:

### Disqualifying Carpentries Community COIs

- The potential reviewer/editor has developed a Carpentries lesson with an author with a major role
- The potential reviewer/editor has intentionally taught multiple workshops with an author with a major role
- The potential reviewer/editor and any author with a major role have served as Maintainers together on the same lesson

### Non-disqualifying Carpentries Community COIs

- The potential reviewer/editor has taken Instructor Training with an author with a major role
- The potential reviewer/editor and an author with a major role have contributed to the same lesson
- The potential reviewer/editor and an author with a major role have attended a community discussion together

The quality of The Carpentries Lab, as with the entire Carpentries organization, is driven by the contributions of the community. We ask that reviewers and editors are honest about potential conflicts of interest, even those that may fall outside the specific criteria outline here, for the sake of the reputation and quality of The Carpentries Lab lessons.
