# The Carpentries Lab Editor/Reviewer Conflict of Interest Policy

_Note: this text is copied from the policy used by RopenSci for their open software review process._

Following criteria are meant to be a guide for what constitutes a conflict of interest for an editor or reviewer. The potential editor or reviewer has a conflict of interest if:

- The authors with a major role are from the potential reviewer/editorâ€™s institution or institutional component (e.g., department)
- Within in the past three years, the potential reviewer/editor has been a collaborator or has had any other professional relationship with any person on the package who has a major role
- The potential reviewer/editor serves as a member of the advisory board for the project under review
- The potential reviewer/editor would receive a direct or indirect financial benefit if the package is accepted
- The potential reviewer/editor has significantly contributed to a competitor project.
- There is also a lifetime COI for the family members, business partners, and thesis student/advisor or mentor.

In the case where none of the associate editors can serve as editor, an external guest editor will be recruited.
