# The Carpentries Lab

Thank you for your interest in The Carpentries Lab! This repository is used to track the lessons that are aimed to be reviewed by our
community. Our reviews are open, and their goal is to ensure that the lessons follow best practices in pedagogy and the general teaching practices
used in Carpentries workshops.

Everyone participating in The Carpentries Lab agrees to follow The Carpentries [Code of Conduct][coc].

**We are currently piloting our lesson review process, and are commiting only to review lessons by invitation. If you have not been invited to submit your lesson to The Carpentries Lab, you may still open an issue to request a review but should expect some delay in the processing of your submission.**

## Why The Carpentries Lab?

There is excitement and interest in the way The Carpentries teach and deliver workshops. We are developing tools and templates for lessons that have proven to be effective to format and deliver both in workshop settings and for self-guided learning.

There is also a need from learners who have participated in our workshops to explore further topics that can only be covered briefly in our 2-day trainings.

The goal of The Carpentries Lab is to be **a repository of high-quality, community-reviewed, discoverable lessons**. People already familiar with The Carpentries teaching practice can pick them up and teach them in meetups, in class, or in complement of a "standard" Carpentries 2-day workshop. The lessons can also be used by independent learners, outside of workshops.

This repository is the place where lessons can be submitted and reviewed for inclusion in The Carpentries Lab.

If you want to begin creating a new lesson, or transfer
an existing lesson to a place where other members of The Carpentries
community can contribute to further its development,
please submit a proposal to [The Carpentries Incubator][carpentries-incubator].

## Why should you submit your lesson to The Carpentries Lab?

* As a lesson author, you value the feedback from reviewers, and you are
  interested in receiving feedback and contributions from members of the
  community.
* You will receive a badge and banner for your lesson, indicating that
  it is undergoing/has passed the peer review process.
* The Carpentries will publicize your lessons through The Carpentries Lab
  website.

## What makes a lesson a good candidate for The Carpentries Lab?

### Essential

A lesson is eligible for inclusion in The Carpentries Lab if:

* it uses The Carpentries [lesson template][lesson-template].
* it conforms to our [Code of Conduct][coc].
* it is licensed [CC-BY][cc-by-human] or [CC0][cc0-human].
* it has been taught at least two times by Instructors who had not been heavily involved in the development of the lesson before that point.
* it conforms to The Carpentries approach to curriculum development detailed in our [Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh].

### Preferred

A lesson is particularly well-suited to The Carpentries Lab if:

* it teaches skills related to those covered by [The Carpentries existing Lesson Programs][lesson-programs].
* it can be taught in 1.5, 3, or 6 hours.
* it teaches open-source tools where possible.

## What is the process for submitting a lesson to The Carpentries Lab?

**We are currently piloting our lesson review process, and are commiting only to review lessons by invitation. If you have not been invited to submit your lesson to The Carpentries Lab, you may still open an issue to request a review but should expect some delay in the processing of your submission.**

* To request a review, [open an issue in this repository][new-issue] and respond to the prompts in the _Review submission_  issue template
* The editor will [assess the submission for fit and overall quality][editor-guide], and assign reviewers.
* The reviewers will use [The Carpentries checklists and guidelines][reviewer-guide] to provide feedback on the lesson.
* Once accepted, the lesson will be transfered to [The Carpentries Lab GitHub organization][lab-gh-org], updated to use The Carpentries Lab theme, and be listed on The Carpentries Lab website.

_This process is inspired by the software review from [rOpenSci][ropensci]_
